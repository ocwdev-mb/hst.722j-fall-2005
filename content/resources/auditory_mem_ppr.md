description: This resource provides information on the topic of psychophysical studies
  find parametric segregation of short-term memory stores, neurophysiological studies
  find neural correlates of short-term retention in medial geniculate body and auditory
  cortex, imaging work implicates auditory cortical, frontal, parietal and cerebellar
  areas in STWM tasks, lesion studies indicate debilitation in STWM performance with
  bilateral auditory association cortical lesions, conclusion and suggested papers.
